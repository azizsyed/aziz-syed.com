After years of iterating through different blogging implementations, I have finally decided to use Jekyll to manage my content. It was not an easy process, as I used many different options to serve as my blog templates, from Wordpress, PHP based CMS's, JavaScript based static site generators (Assemble, Wintersmith), Hugo, and Jekyll.

I opted to use something that is not coded in JavaScript, such that I am forced into understanding a language that I have not used before. I'm excited about this decision and can't wait to dive into what Jekyll has to offer.

My goals really are the following:

* Create a blog website
  * Apply a nice custom theme
  * Logical structure (templates plus overall organization)
  * Use Compass/Sass to handle styling
  * Apply a grid layout for fluidity/responsiveness
* Post 2 articles a month
