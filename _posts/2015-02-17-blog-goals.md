It's finally here. My first post ever. After years of experimenting with different content management applications and static site generators, I have finally decided upon Jekyll.

My reasons are the following:

* Utilize a tool outside of JavaScript, such that I'm forced/incentivized into learning a new tool/language
* Don't worry too much about integrating and utilizing all the nice features. This way I can focus on the larger details, e.g. content and minimal styling. Before I was too absorbed into too many minute details which wasted significant effort.
* Get initial content live, and slowly begin the process of making various improvements later.

With the content management setup in place, I can now achieve my (long-standing) goals:

* Create a personal website
  * Apply a modern custom theme
  * Logical structure (templates plus overall organization)
  * Use Compass/Sass to handle styling
  * Apply a grid layout for fluidity/responsiveness
* Post a couple of articles a month
  * Things I have learned
  * Tools/libraries I have used

With this first post in place, I am now in a good spot to continue meeting these goals.
